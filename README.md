### bash examples

This set of examples goes with the "Bite Size Bash" zine (coming out soon!) from https://wizardzines.com

### how to run the examples

To run the globs example, run:

```
bash 12-globs.sh
```

I'd recommend both opening the example file in a text editor (so you can read
the code) and running the example in a terminal (to see the output).
