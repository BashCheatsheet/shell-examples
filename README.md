### bash examples

This set of examples goes with zine [Bite Size Bash](https://wizardzines.com/zines/bite-size-bash). There's approximately one file per page of the zine.

### how to run the examples

To run the globs example, run:

```
bash 12-globs.sh
```

I'd recommend both opening the example file in a text editor (so you can read
the code) and running the example in a terminal (to see the output).

### and play around with them!

If you're confused about something in one of the examples, experiment! Make
your own examples! See what happens! I've learned a LOT about bash by just
experimenting with different tiny shell scripts and making sure I understand
what they're doing.
